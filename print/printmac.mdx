## Set up

1. Navigate to System Settings > Printers and Scanners (this is called System Preferences > Printers and Scanners on older versions of macOS).
2. Click the Add Printer, Scanner or Fax button under the Printers List (this is a + icon on older versions of macOS).
   - The Add Printer dialog is displayed. It displays a list of all of the discovered printers on the network.
3. Select a printer that uses the Bonjour protocol. The Name, Location, and Use is displayed.
4. At the bottom of the dialog box, check that Use is set to Secure AirPrint.
5. If Secure AirPrint isn’t displayed:
   a. Close the Add dialog.
   b.Disconnect from the network, then reconnect to it again.
   c.Check if you can see Secure AirPrint now. If you can’t, contact your System Administrator.
6. Click Add.
7. Print your document. When prompted, enter your PaperCut username and password.

<Note>
If you enter the wrong authentication details, MacBook devices do not show any warning message; your job just will not print.

If your job doesn’t print, check the Print Queue dialog. If the print job is there and has the message Held for authentication, click the icon; then re-enter your login details.

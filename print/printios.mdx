## Set Up

Mobility Print works just like AirPrint—print your content as you normally would!

You’ll be prompted to enter your PaperCut Username and Password.

<Tip>
Make sure your iPhone or iPad is connected to the Life Time Work network!

You can find detailed print instructions in [Use AirPrint to print from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201387) .
